At TAIL, we aim to cultivate a new generation of researchers and engineers that
can bring a broad interdisciplinary perspective to topics at the intersection
of AI, Cognitive and Learning Sciences, and HCI.
Independent studies provides an entry point for students to try out being a
scientist by shadowing and working with scientists in our lab.
This document describes the independent study process.

## How to Apply
The very first thing you should do is review the lab web site (if you're
reading this, then good! you're off to a good start) to determine if the
research you are passionate about is a good fit for the lab. Good entry points
are the [about](/index.html) and [research](/research.html) pages, which
outline the research currently being conducted in the lab. 

Many students reach out to inquire about reserach opportunities without taking
the time to try to understand the research we do first. We receive more
independent study requests than we can support each year, so when we receive
generic inquiries that do not align with our work, then they are less likely to
get accepted, or even to get a response (sorry!).

As you review these projects, consider how your research interests intersect
with them and any ideas you have about how your potential independent study topic
might build on and advance these projects Also, take a look at relevant publications
(usually included on the project description pages) and try to identify the
TAIL researchers that are working on them. The folks that are working on the
projects you find most interesting might make good potential mentors for your
independent study project. Try to identify at least one researcher besides
Chris MacLellan. Chris loves to mentor, but unfortunately has the smallest
amount of time of anyone in the lab to do so, so its important to identify
others that could serve as your primary mentor.

One bit of advice is that we generally prefer candidates that are a good fit
for helping to advance our active projects. This is in contrast to people proposing
completely new independent projects (although, this is sometimes ok too, but it
would have to really catch our interest!). This lets you hit the ground running
because there is an existing project and it offers a pathway for you to
potentially continue on with the project after your independent study is
done.

Once you've reviewed the projects, got a good sense for how your work might
connect with them, and you've identified a potential mentor, then you should
review the general lab [expectations and
responsibilities](/manual/#expectations-and-responsibilities) as well as those
specific to students completing an [independent
study](/manual/#students-doing-independent-study-undergraduate-and-graduate).

Finally, after completing the above, you should proceed to fill out an
[application](https://forms.office.com/r/455mrxTSFa) to work in the lab. Please
fill out this application before reaching out via email and if you do follow
up, then please reference your application in your message.

## Preparing a Research Plan
If you are selected to participate in an independent study, then you will be
paired with a mentor (likely the one you identified above). Your first task as
a researcher will be to work with your mentor to prepare a research plan, which
you will ideally submit prior to starting your independent study (or by the
second week at the latest). When preparing your plan, please try to answer the
following [Heilmeier
questions](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism) (a standard
set of questions by organizations like DARPA to evaluate proposed research
plans):
* What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
* How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
* What's new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
* Who cares? If you're successful, what difference will it make?
* What are the risks and the payoffs?
* How much will it cost?
* How long will it take?
* What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?

Your research plan should be no more than 2 pages and written primarily by
you, with guidance and feedback provided by your mentor.

## Milestones
Your plan should also include the key outputs of your project as well as a
timeline for when they will be delivered. All independent study projects must
include four deliverables: 
- Your independent study plan (see section above) within 2 weeks of the beginning of the semester.
- A midterm self evaluation using this [form](https://forms.office.com/r/wieRbqsLMR) at week 8.
- Slides for a final presentation that you will give at one of the lab meetings in the last 2 weeks of the semester.
- A final self evaluation using this [form](https://forms.office.com/r/wieRbqsLMR) in the final week.

## Evaluation and Reflection
As mentioned before, a key goal for our group is to foster the next
generation of scientists and engineers. Towards this end, the following rubric
outlines several key skills that enable scientists to be successful. At the
middle and end of your independent study, you will conduct a self-evaluation using
this rubric, giving yourself a rating along each dimension and provide evidence
to support each rating. You will also provide an overall grade (A,B,C,D, or
F) for your independent study research activities, with an accompanying
justification. Your mentor will review your self-evaluation and provide
additional feedback. Although Chris reserves the right to make adjustments, if
your grade is well justified, then it will be entered as your mid and final
grade for the independent study. 

As part of each of your evaluations, you will also be asked to provide feedback
on your independent study experience, so we can work to improve it every year.

The form to submit your midterm and final evaluations can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/r/wieRbqsLMR).

Here is the rubric:

| Criteria                   | Excellent (4)             | Good (3)              | Fair (2)            | Poor (1)            |

## I finished my independent study, what's next?

Once you complete your independent study, there are a couple of possible next steps that you might consider. We have identified three possible pathways to continued engagement with the lab:
* Paid graduate reserach position: If your mentor and Chris are impressed by
  your work, and if funding is available to support it, there is a possibility
  that you could continue on in the lab under a paid graduate research
  assistantship. Although we cannot always provide this option, you are
  encouraged to speak with your mentor about this possibility.
* Master thesis: if you are in a master's program and are considering a thesis
  option, this might be another pathway to continued involvement with TAIL. Please
  let your mentor know if this is something you would like to pursue so the issue
  can be raised to Chris's attention.
* Paid graduate teaching position: Another possible option to continued engagement is
  to become a teaching assistant in one of Chris's courses (e.g.,
  knowledge-based AI). Please speak with your mentor (and Chris directly!), if you are
  interested in this possibility.
* Unpaid research leading to a publication: Finally, although conducting work without
  receiving pay or course credit is generally not encouraged at TAIL, we do
  recognize that sometimes it can be beneficial to engage in unpaid research that
  results in a publication (published papers can be a strong differentiator in
  graduate school applications). If this is something you are interested in
  pursuing, then please speak with your mentor about this possiblity.
