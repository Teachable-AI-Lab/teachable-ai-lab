In the Spring, Chris teaches a course on Human-AI Interaction, this page
describes the course, its structure, and the topics covered for those that
might be interested in taking it.

# Course Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are widespread and already
transforming nearly every aspect of society. As AI becomes more broadly
embedded in technologies that interact with and affect everyday people, it is
increasingly important to consider human-AI interaction design as part of the
AI system development process. This class introduces the unique design
challenges presented by AI. It explores questions of usability and user
experience specific to AI systems, and it reflects more broadly on the
relationship between humanity and emerging technologies. Students will practice
skills in design, research and writing regarding the human side of AI. Topics
include AI and society, interactive system design, speculative design, fairness,
explainability, human augmentation/amplification, etc. No programming
experience required.

# Learning Goals

As a result of your experience in this course, you will be able to:
* Develop a deep understanding of what human–AI interaction (HAII) is,
  including its foundations, current issues, and future potential.
* Cultivate a critical mindset for thinking about AI, HAII, and related topics,
  that will enable you to more successfully navigate research and practice
  within the HAII space.
* Develop your metacognition and your ability to learn about learning, so that
  you can managing your own learning and success.
* Explain the design challenges that AI systems present.
* Evaluate the arguments for and against the application of AI in various
  aspects of human society and participate in public discourse on these topics.
* Advocate for AI applications and design choices you care about using the
  knowledge and skills gained in this course, such as ensuring fairness and
  accessibility in AI systems.

# Participation & Attendance

Evidence suggests that time spent actively and deliberately engaging with content is directly
correlated with learning (see Chi's [ICAP
Framework](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1044018.pdf)). We will utilize
class time to discuss the readings and class topics as a group. I expect you to
complete the readings each week, post on Ed discussion something about the
paper, and to come to every class ready to discuss the papers, what you posted,
and to engage in group activities.

# Readings

There is no required textbook in this course. We will read several articles
each week, but these will be made available freely. If you would like to
supplement your reading in this course with other books and podcasts on the
topic of HAII, see the Additional Resources section below.

# Key Activities

The primary activity for the course will be reading and discussion. I have
intentionally designed the class to not have lots of assignment, so I fully
expect you to do the reading in preparation for each class.

Prior to each class you will:
* READ the papers outlined on the schedule
* POST approximately 1 paragraph about the paper on Ed Discussion. As part of
  this paragraph, please list questions, issues, comments, or thoughts you have
  about each paper. The main purpose of this post is to anchor your reading and
  to force you to think about and refine a few key ideas to discuss in class. It
  also will enable the teaching team to track your participation.

In addition to the activities you will do for each class, you will also write
three short essays (1-2 pages) and review your peers essays on the following
topics:
* WRITE a 1-2 page critique of an existing human-AI interaction technology;
* WRITE a 1-2 page proposal for a new human-AI interaction technology; and
* WRITE a 1-2 page essay reflecting on what they think human-AI interaction is.

# Course Grading

This course will utilize an “ungrading” model. What this means is that I will
not provide numerical or letter grades to assess your performance. Instead, I
will provide you with feedback and guidance in whatever form I believe will
best support your learning. As this feedback is intended solely for your
development, it will not be linked to your grade within the class.

To support this grading model, I am asking you to provide me with three short
reflective essays over the course of the term:
* A learning goals self-assessment, a description of your learning goals for
  the course, outlining what you hope to learn and how you hope to use it in
  the future;
* A Midterm learning self-assessment, where you outline the effort they have
  invested in the course, reflect on your progress and what works or does not
  work for promoting your learning; and
* A final learning self-assessment, where you outline your overall effort and
  achievements over the duration of the course. You will also provide a grade
  (in percentages) that you believe that you deserve with a justification of the
  grade. I will review your grade and justification with the goal of honoring
  your assessment and entering it as your overall grade for the course. If I see
  any major discrepancies between your self-assessment and my own assessment, I
  will reach out to discuss with you.

# Contacting Me

Student–instructor interaction is an important part of any course. I am
available to you, and I want to help you succeed in this course, in your
program at Georgia Tech, and in life. Please come to me with any questions,
problems, discoveries, or anything else you’d like to share. If you have a
question that may be of interest to others in the class (e.g., syllabus,
readings, logistics, etc.), please ask it during class so that others can
benefit. With personal or urgent questions, email me directly or speak to me
before or after class.

## Office Hours

I will not be hosting fixed office hours. If you'd like to quickly discuss
something, then please come speak with me after class. If it requires a longer
discussion, then please send me an email and we can arrange a meeting.

## Emailing Me

If you email me, then please put “HAII” in the subject line so that I do not
overlook your email. Please note that I do not generally check email on nights
or weekends. In our always-on society, it is important to set
boundaries because healthy lives require off-time, and because our
academic activities require uninterrupted periods of time for reading, writing,
and thinking. Moreover, taking time to rest and pursue leisure activities has
been shown to improve productivity, creativity and accomplishment, as Alex Pang
discusses in his book Rest: Why You Get More Done When You Work Less. I hope
you will join me in living with more balance.

# Health & Wellness

I understand that this course is being offered in a time of tremendous change
and uncertainty, and I recognize that you (and I) may encounter unexpected
challenges during this term. That includes challenges related to health and
illness, technology, caregiving responsibilities, work responsibilities, and
more.

My goal this semester is to support you in doing the best work you can in light
of the challenges you face. I understand that students face tremendous pressure
to work hard, get “good” grades, and be as “successful” as possible. That said,
I encourage you to remember that your health and well-being are far more
important than the work you do in this class or any class. And I encourage you
to take the time you need to care for yourself and for your loved ones.

If you are finding it difficult to balance your health and well-being with your
work in this class, please let me know. It is okay to ask for help and to
acknowledge when you are struggling, and I am happy to help connect you with
resources and services on campus and also make accommodations to our course
plan as needed. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress,
difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly
encourage you to seek support. The Center for Mental Health Care & Resources is
here to help: [https://mentalhealth.gatech.edu](https://mentalhealth.gatech.edu).
Lastly, I also ask that you be patient with me. The challenges of this
semester may force me to make last-minute changes to the course. I will do my
best to communicate any changes clearly and make them with respect for the
inconvenience, frustration, and confusion that change may cause.

# Accomodations

If you are a student with learning needs that require special accommodation, contact the Office of
Disability Services at (404)894-2563 or
[http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/](http://disabilityservices.gatech.edu/),
 as soon as possible, to make an appointment to discuss your special needs and
to obtain an accommodations letter. Please also e-mail me as soon as possible
in order to set up a time to discuss your learning needs.
